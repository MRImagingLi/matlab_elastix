## What is it?
MelastiX is a collection of wrappers for the open source image registration suite [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/). Elastix is cross-platform and is normally called from the system command-line (no GUI). MelastiX allows the elastix and transformix commands it to be called from within MATLAB as though they are native MATLAB commands. e.g. the user can feed in MATLAB matrices instead of image file names.
